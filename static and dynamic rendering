1- for those htmnl pages which are static we donot require any extra view engine like pug or ejs
we can simply store them in any folder say static_assests which will contain css js or static htmls or even images

we have to use

app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/static_assests')); in server.js

With app.use(express.static(â€¦)) you're defining a middleware whose only purpose is to serve static files like JS/CSS.

and while sending such files we have to use 
res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '..', 'static_assests', 'static.html'))


directory structure is :
- server.js
- routes -> some api.js
- public assests-> static.html




2- for dynamic html we will have to install view engine like pug [ npm imstall --save pug]
then we can use res.render to render those pages


we have to use
app.set('views', __dirname + '/views'); 

With app.set('views', â€¦) 
you're setting the Express's app setting which is

A directory or an array of directories for the application's views. 
If an array, the views are looked up in the order they occur in the array.

and in api.js
res.render('dynamic')

for directory structure

directory structure is :
- server.js
- routes -> some api.js
- views-> dynamic.pug
